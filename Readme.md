# Upgrade instructions

## Version 1.1 &rarr; 1.2

Delete the Planetary Drill mod configurations. For Windows users it's located here:
	`C:\Users\<your username>`\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\`

If you have a savegame with custom added drill configurations then you'll have to restore those settings first in the mod settings menu before loading your savefile. This is because some namespaces changed and v1.1 saves aren't always compatible with v1.2.

# Dependency instructions for developers

For Steam users: you can find the references for your project here (requires Rimworld to be installed):

`<Rimworld Steam installation folder>\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\RimWorldWin64_Data\Managed`

Note that RimWorldWin64_Data can have a slightly different name.
